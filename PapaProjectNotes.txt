	1. Allocagte a "Connection" object
	2. Allocate a "Statement" object, under the "Connection" object created
	3. Query database:
		a. Execute a SQL "SELECT" query by calling the "executeQuery()" method of the "Statement" object, which returns the query results  in a "ResultSer" object; or
		b. Execute a SQL "INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE" command by calling the "executeUpdate()" method of the "Statement" object, which returns an int indicating the number of rows affected
	4. Process the query result
	5. Free the resources by closing the "Statement" and "Connection"
	
* in html, <form method = "get" action = "http..."> -> gives you the absolute url = exact location but not helpful if you change anything about the required file
	- instead use a realtive url, gives it a general location so that it can still be found if moved
		in this case: action="query"
